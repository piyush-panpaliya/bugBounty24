For our brand logo we wanted to show that our platform gives you wings. Wings to your money to help you fly to your goal through our highly optimised financial adisory and planning platform

### Our Vision:
We aim to be a platform to help you plan all your financial needs. Whether it is trading, investing, budgeting, spends analysis or general saving. We keep a track you so you don't need to. While in its beginner phase we plan to grow into a one stop solution for any and all financial needs. We want to be the platform that comes to mind when you think of finance. We plan to be able to provide unique features like terms and conditions analyser, budget analyser, tax advising, etc. We believe in user privacy and thus we keep all user information end-to-end encrypted (subject to terms and conditions). There is no physical person behind this platform, our system is completely automated and involves pre-trained models so that your data stays with you. Currently while we only support features for individual entities, we want to be able to create joint accounts for families and businesses.

2. Spends Analytics and Visualization compared to people with a similiar financial portfolio
3. Finance related user specific tips and suggestions along with general information about in depth terms related to finance
4. Text summarization and Analysis for legal/important papers (eg, contract papers)
5. Five/Ten/Twenty year planning for future goals. This will aim to predict our financial status in the future. (While currently uses simple compounding formula, we plan to make it capable of predicting noise in the market and statistical trends in financial systems)
6. Trading and Investments related suggestions, profit/loss predictions, trending options, etc (FUTURE PLAN)

#### For our future releases we plan to add the following features:
1. In depth analysis for customer portfolios and scrutiny for reasons of profit/loss

3. Providing vouchers and offers to some of the most popular brands
4. Ability to book tickets and flights at good rates
5. Ability to add goals such that the model understands its importance and can then customize the budget and resources so as to buy the item.
6. Ability to stronly differentiate between need and want.
7. Provide information and tax systems and other such financial systems.
8. Feedback system for auto improvement of the model

### Business Plan and Scalability
Our motto is to be the best option when it comes to financial needs. For a sustainable growth we have mainly 3 main business models:
1. **Google AdSense:** Google offers $0.2 to $0.5 for every 1000 views. We expect a retention of 50-60% for the viewers of our platform. With an assumption of 200,000 visitors daily we have a revenue of roughly $33 per day.
2. **Subscription Model:** For some of our advance features we plan on offering a nominal fee of $7 per month. For the normal plan we would offer 'x' tokens on our features/analysers, while the premium model would not have any limit. Assuming 50,000 concurrent users per month, we would have $350,000 per month.
3. **Service Charge for coupons and offers by large brands:** Assuming the same rates as Google AdSense, we expect a revenue of $3 per coupon used. Assuming 5,000 coupon uses per month, we have $15,000 per month

**All in all with the current assumptions we can expect a revenue of $4,392,045 per year.**

Moving on to Scalability of our application, we can clearly see the addition of numerous features to be a one stop solution for finance related needs. Some of them have been mentioned previously. Just as the field of finance is ever evolving so will our application. It will always be completely automated for complete privacy and with employ popular risk analysis strategies, algo-trading techniques, reinforcement learning based market analysers and many more.
